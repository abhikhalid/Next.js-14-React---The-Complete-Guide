Here we have both front-end and backend project.

for front-end,

npm i
npm run dev

now, navigate to the backend and run it

cd backend
npm install
npm start

If we use our custom data source directly, only 'Full Route Cache' will work. Apart from that, Request Memoization and Data Cache will not work here. Because we no longer using fetch here.
