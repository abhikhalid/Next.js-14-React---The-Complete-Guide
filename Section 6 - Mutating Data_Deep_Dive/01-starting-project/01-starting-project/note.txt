-> Catching Differences: Development vs Production

npm run build

to see the Production Test, to start the Production Server of Next JS Application.

npm start

Now go to New Post and create a new Post. Go to Feed. Wait what? Where is our post? We can not see it because NEXT JS does some pretty aggressive Catching.

When Preparing Post Page in the Production, It pre-render all your pages during that build process and catches those pre-rendered pages and then it never re-renders them there after unless there are dynamic pages with dynamic segments.

We should tell NEXT JS that it should re-render some of these pages whenever we change the data.
